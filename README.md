# AI BASED DOCTOR-PATIENT ASSISTANCE FOR DETERMINING A SUITABLE HEARING AID

Hearing loss affects millions of people worldwide, and selecting the right hearing aid can be a complex and overwhelming process. Users often struggle with comparing different hearing aids based on their budget, hearing loss levels, and brand preferences. Traditional methods of choosing a hearing aid involve either relying on online reviews—often leading to mixed feedback and confusion—or seeking recommendations from individuals who may not have accurate or personalized knowledge.

To address this problem, this project presents an AI-based hearing aid recommendation system that utilizes Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict the most suitable hearing aid based on user input. By considering key factors such as budget (price range) and hearing loss in decibels, the model processes this data and suggests the best hearing aid brand that fits the user's needs.

This AI-powered solution aims to simplify the selection process, making healthcare more accessible and efficient. The system not only reduces the time users spend searching for information but also provides personalized recommendations with high accuracy, enhancing the overall user experience.
